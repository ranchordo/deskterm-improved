Deskterm - because who doesn't want a desktop that looks like this?

Deskterm improved is made mostly for Ubuntu, and should work on other Debian-based systems running with GNOME. Running on other systems should be doable, but it may require some modification.  
Installation is as easy as:
```
(clone the repository)
cd deskterm-improved
chmod +x installDeskterm.sh
./installDeskterm.sh
```
Uninstalling is also easy:
```
~/.deskterm/uninstall.sh
```
If you want to run your own scripts or change the terminal's functionality, most functionality is specified in `~/.deskterm/startup.sh`.
